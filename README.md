# end-to-end-learning-of-graph-similarity-
test code and trained model for paper "End-to-End Learning of Graph Similarity"

the dataset is quite large and will be available later

# notice
the version is poor implementation and not suitable for everyone, I will enrich the doc and reimplement the code later. The network data is collected from KONECT (http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/) and some augmentation techniques are used to enlarge networks datasets, which are introduced in our paper.
